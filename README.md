# kebinImportsMongoose

***This is just an automated installer for Among Us, through Steam. Town of Us by polusgg, BetterCrewLink by OhMyGuus.***
> **Yes, you must own the game through Steam for this to work.**

## Installation

> ***LITERALLY JUST RUN IT AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.***

## Build

* **kebinImportsMongoose can only be built with .NET6.0.**  
   * This is due to the fact that .NET5.0 gives a seemingly unsolvable class error for WebClient.  
   * If someone can help with this, please do.  
> The following command can be used to build kebinImportsMongoose into a single Executable File.  
```dosbatch
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release -o publish -p:PublishReadyToRun=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true --self-contained true
```
