## Installation

> ***LITERALLY JUST RUN IT AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.***


## Build

> ***kebinImportsMongoose can only be built with .NET6.0.  
> This is due to the fact that .NET5.0 gives a seemingly unsolvable class error for WebClient.  
> If someone can help with this, please do.  
> The following command can be used to build kebinImportsMongoose into a single Executable File.  
```dosbatch
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release -o publish -p:PublishReadyToRun=true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true --self-contained true
